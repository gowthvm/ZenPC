## CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST (CAC) IMPROVEMENT

```
Total Marketing Spend / Number of Customers Acquired = CAC

If you spend $10,000/month on marketing:

After redesign (with better conversion):
- 42 customers (40% more) = $238 CAC

CAC Reduction: -29%
```

### Lifetime Value (LTV) Consideration
```
If average customer LTV = $5,000:

Before: LTV/CAC = 5,000/333 = 15:1 (Good)
After:  LTV/CAC = 5,000/238 = 21:1 (Excellent)

CAC Recovery: +6 months faster
```
